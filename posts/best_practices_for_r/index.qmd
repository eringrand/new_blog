# R Coding Best Practices & Guidelines

## Projects:

The ideal folder structure should look like this:

-   [projectname].Rproj - R project file (do not commit this to GitHub)
-   .gitignore - used for git repos so you don’t publish something
    private
-   Archive/ - anything from a past run that is no longer needed but
    should be kept “just in case”
-   Input/ - mappings or downloaded reports Scripts/ - location for
    scripts and internal Quarto documents
-   Reports/ - location for Quatro reports for projects with multiple
    report documents that all stem from the same project
-   Output/ - csv or Excel outputs, plots, report PDF location Temp/ -
    intermediary outputs

## Code structure

The code should be structured as

1.  Load libraries
2.  Define functions; do not define functions inside other functions
3.  Gather all data
4.  Clean all data
5.  Analysis
6.  Build reports

For larger projects, code should often be broken down into several
scripts. Naming conventions could follow: 00_functions.R, 01_get_data.R,
02_clean_data.R , … etc

### Plan for the future of the project Code documentation

1.  Create a project README file to include the context of the project
    and data.
    1.  Any planning documents should be linked here.
2.  Use code comments to let future code users know WHY you did
    something, not what it is doing.
3.  Use NOTE, TODO, ...etc to help you find important things (like
    changing a hardcoded variable for the following year)
    2.  The todor package is an excellent add-in for RStudio. It lists
        out the notes, comments, and location of your notes throughout
        the project directory.
4.  Link to any supplemental documentation in the project and/or code

Unit testing:

1.  Use assertr functions to be certain that aspects that you expect of
    the data are not changing, and if they do change, they will cause an
    error 2. Check your data as you go to confirm it looks like what you
    expect it to 3. Get a code review before publishing the output a.
    Policy: Code on GitHub needs sign-off before publishing results

Safety first Do NOT ever hardcode usernames & passwords into your code.
Use the .Renviorn file (via usethis::edit_r_environ()) to store
usernames & passwords and call them using `Sys.getenv()`

Follow data privacy best practices, particularly as they relate to
GitHub and Google Drive. Do not publish raw data with identifiable
information in a public place. 5. General best practices - Use the
tidyverse version of the functions whenever possible because they often
have better defaults and documentation

e.g. `read_csv()` instead of `read.csv()` or `if_else()` instead of
`ifelse()`

Team Package Widely used functions should be put in the central team
package.
